# Wordpress Theme Boilerplate
A Wordpress theme boilerplate that follows BEM methodology and organizes assets using an SMACSS approach. It comes with Webpack that includes BrowserSync for auto-reloading / proxing a server, Babel for writing ES6-based javascript modules (if needed), Autoprefixer for cross-browser compatibility, and uses SCSS as the main loader for styles.

This branch uses Parcel for bundling, instead of Webpack. 

## Installation
1. Install Parcel globally: `npm install -g parcel-bundler`
2. `cd` into project folder and run `npm install`
3. run `npm run devparcel`, then go to http://localhost:sitename in browser
